# ReAuth
A Mod to Re-Login to Mojang while Minecraft is still running



This Mod fixes the Problem of having to restart your Client when your Session invalidates
A nice sideeffect is that you can change Accounts while Minecraft is running

The Mod is clientside only - it will not work in servers mods folder

Just hit the "Re-Login" Button in the Multiplayermenu and enter your Logindata, after that you will be able to login on your Servers

I know that entering your Logindata simply into a Mod might sound risky, but thats why i have the Source on GitHub as well as a link to a Java-Decompiler

Modpacks:
       You are free to include it in your Modpack, if it is free of charge, but Post/PM would be nice for my Statistics ....
